Since the summer of 2013, I've been working on web development with <a href="http://rubyonrails.org/">Ruby on Rails</a>.

From October 2008 until June 2013 I was developing some software (Java/Jython) for the <a href="http://sci.esa.int/science-e/www/area/index.cfm?fareaid=16">Herschel Space Observatory</a>, which was launched in May 2009. One of my main responsibilities was to implement advanced methods of point source extraction for use on data from the <a href="http://pacs.ster.kuleuven.ac.be/">PACS</a> and <a href="http://www.spire.rl.ac.uk/">SPIRE</a> instruments on Herschel. I was doing this work first as a Research Fellow in Astronomy at Sussex University until July 2012, and since August 2012 I was working as a consultant with <a href="http://blueskyspectroscopy.com/">Blue Sky Spectroscopy</a>, working on the software for the spectrometer on SPIRE.

Between October 2004 and September 2008 I worked with <a href="http://astronomy.sussex.ac.uk/~loveday/">Jon Loveday</a> for a DPhil (PhD), <em><a href="/phdthesis.pdf">A census of K-band galaxies from the UKIDSS Large Area Survey</a></em> looking at hundreds of thousands of galaxies in near-<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrared_astronomy">infrared</a> light. The main source of data for this project was a new survey, <a href="http://www.ukidss.org/">UKIDSS</a>. (Jon Loveday and I were at the telescope in <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/63259851@N00/sets/">Hawaii</a> when the first UKIDSS survey observations were made in May 2005.) I also used data from <a href="http://www.sdss.org/">SDSS</a> and <a href="http://www.ipac.caltech.edu/2mass/">2MASS</a>.

The main results included a K-band luminosity function from UKIDSS (with redshifts from SDSS), along with the bivariate brightness distribution (number of galaxies per unit volume as a function of luminosity and surface brightness). See <a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2009MNRAS.397..868S">this paper</a>.

From 2002-2003 I studied for the new MSc in Cosmology at the University of Sussex. Around half of my work that year was spent on my project, <em><a href="/mscthesis.pdf">Braneworld Inflation</a></em>, supervised by <a href="http://astronomy.sussex.ac.uk/~andrewl/andrewl.html">Andrew Liddle</a>. If you want to know more, see <a href="http://link.aps.org/abstract/PRD/v68/e061301">this paper</a> (or <a href="http://uk.arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0307017">here</a>). Cosmology is the study of the Universe, so the MSc made me a <strong>master of the universe</strong>. In fact, I reckon (but am just about willing to be corrected) that I was the first person anywhere to have a masters degree entitled 'cosmology'. This therefore made me indisputably <em><a href="http://www.he-man.org/cartoon/cartoon.php?id=44">the</a></em><a href="http://www.he-man.org/cartoon/cartoon.php?id=44"> master of the universe</a> for a year, as I'd wanted to be since I was very small.

Prior to starting the MSc, I was at <a href="http://www.jesus.cam.ac.uk/">Jesus College</a>, <a href="http://www.cam.ac.uk/">Cambridge</a>, where I gained a BA in <a href="http://www.maths.cam.ac.uk/">mathematics</a>.
