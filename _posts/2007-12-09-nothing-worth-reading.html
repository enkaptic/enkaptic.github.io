<p>This is the first entry in the new Research Blog, reserved for posts of a tedious, technical or boring nature related to my research in astronomy. See <a href="http://www.anthonysmith.me.uk">www.anthonysmith.me.uk</a> for (slightly) more exciting posts. None of the information in this post is of any interest.</p>
