<p><a title="ESO: European Southern Observatory" href="http://www.eso.org/"><img title="ESO" src="{{ site.url }}/assets//esologo.jpg" alt="ESO" align="right" /></a>Just back from my first visit to Garching (near Munich). <a href="http://www.eso.org/">ESO</a>, to be more specific. The reason for the visit: a three-day workshop on <a href="http://www.ukidss.org/esoworkshop/">Science from UKIDSS</a>.</p>
<p>Here's the gist of it. Lots of good results already, lots of work in progress, and a sense that <a href="http://www.ukidss.org/">UKIDSS</a> has come of age: the needle-in-a-haystack hunters now have enough hay (they hope!) to find some record-breaking needles (the smallest, nearest or furthest known luminiferous objects in the Universe) and the (Galactic or extra-Galactic) Gallup pollers have now canvassed enough  individuals (stars or galaxies) to be reasonably confident about the views of the whole population.</p>
<p>I'm one of the extra-Galactic Gallup pollers. Some slides from the talk I gave on the final morning are on my (small but growing!) <a href="http://astronomy.sussex.ac.uk/~anthonys/publications/">publications page</a>.</p>
<p>Next tasks:</p>
<ul>
<li>Investigate the problem with deblending of large galaxies</li>
<li>Write paper</li>
<li>Write thesis</li>
<li>Get job</li>
</ul>
