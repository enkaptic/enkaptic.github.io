<p>Two methods of approximating a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_spread_function">point-spread function</a> in IDL:</p>
<p>1. <a href="http://www.bo.astro.it/~giangi/StarFinder/">StarFinder</a> seems to do a great job at finding point sources in crowded fields. It includes a routine for generating the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airy_pattern">Airy pattern</a>. For a 51 x 51 array, with the peak at [25, 25], and an FWHM of 8.0 pixels, this is the command:</p>
<pre lang="text">psf = airy_pattern(51, 51, 25, 25, 2./8.0)
isurface, psf</pre>
<p>The output looks something like this:</p>

<p>2. The <a href="http://idlastro.gsfc.nasa.gov/">IDL Astronomy User's Library</a> contains a routine, psf_gaussian, that produces a Gaussian PSF. To produce the same as above, the command would be:</p>
<pre lang="text">psf = psf_gaussian(npix=51, fwhm=8.0, /double)
isurface, psf</pre>
<p>... which produces something like this:</p>
